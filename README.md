# Quickstart for Node.js in the App Engine standard environment

This application may or may not have security vulnerailities in it. Dependabot hath brought fourth a premonition of doom.

I don't maintain this project anymore, so YMMV.

This is the sample application for the
[Quickstart for Node.js in the App Engine standard environment][tutorial]
tutorial found in the [Google App Engine Node.js standard environment][appengine]
documentation.
